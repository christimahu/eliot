# Comprehensive Application Lifecycle and Supervision Tests for Eliot IoT System

defmodule Eliot.ApplicationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Comprehensive test suite for Eliot application lifecycle and supervision behavior.

  This test module validates the core OTP application functionality including:
  startup procedures, supervision trees, health monitoring, fault tolerance,
  and telemetry integration. These tests ensure the Eliot IoT system maintains
  reliability and proper error recovery in production environments.

  ## Test Categories

  - **Application Lifecycle**: Startup, shutdown, and health monitoring
  - **Supervision Strategy**: Process management and restart policies  
  - **Fault Tolerance**: System behavior during component failures
  - **Telemetry Integration**: Event emission and monitoring capabilities

  ## Running Tests

      # Run all application tests
      mix test test/eliot/application_test.exs
      
      # Run specific test categories
      mix test test/eliot/application_test.exs --only application_lifecycle
      mix test test/eliot/application_test.exs --only fault_tolerance

  ## Test Philosophy

  These tests focus on the OTP application behavior rather than individual
  component functionality. They verify that the supervision tree properly
  manages process lifecycles and maintains system stability under various
  failure conditions.
